Netflow-indexer is a program that uses xapian to index the flat file databases used by nfdump or flow-tools.

It lets you search a month of netflow data in seconds.  It doesn't index the
actual data, just what IP addresses are seen in which data file.  It is used in
a similar fashion as a bloom filter.
